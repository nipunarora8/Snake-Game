# Snake-Game
This is the basic snake game from the old Nokia phones.<br>
Snakes too need food, help our snake to have his food and win. <br>
This project is a part of Data Structures in Real Life course by Coding Blocks that is helping me implement the data structures like arrays, stack queue's, dynamic programming etc in real life projects.
Thank You
